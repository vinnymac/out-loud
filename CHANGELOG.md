# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Out Loud. See `git log` for the full
history.

## 1.0.4 — 2026-05-23

### UI

- **Textarea no longer reverts to the example text.** The input field used
  a per-render fallback (`settings.text || DEFAULT_TEXT`), which meant any
  empty value snapped back to the example. Typing felt like the field was
  fighting you and clearing it was impossible. Now `DEFAULT_TEXT` is seeded
  into the saved settings only on the first-ever launch; after that, your
  edits (including the empty string) persist properly.

### Release infrastructure (no user-visible change)

- **Switched to Pattern C** for macOS notarization to insulate releases
  from Apple notary outages. CI ships signed-but-not-notarized DMGs to a
  draft release in ~5 min (no waiting on Apple). A new local script
  `scripts/notarize-release.mjs` then downloads, submits to Apple, staples,
  and re-uploads — this can take as long as it needs to without timing out
  the CI runner. See [docs/build/releasing.md](./docs/build/releasing.md)
  for the rationale and step-by-step.

## 1.0.3 — 2026-05-23

### macOS

- **Notarization re-enabled.** Apple's notary service was unhealthy during
  the 1.0.2 release window, so 1.0.2 shipped signed-but-not-notarized and
  triggered the "macOS cannot verify the developer" dialog on first launch.
  Apple's queue cleared later the same day; 1.0.3 is fully Developer-ID
  signed AND notarized. First launch now opens immediately with no prompt.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-05-23

### Cross-platform packaging fixes

- **macOS and Windows**: ship every transitive dependency. The previous
  release shipped `onnxruntime-node` without its `onnxruntime-common` peer,
  which made TTS fail at startup on every platform that got past the
  Gatekeeper / SmartScreen wall. The installer now bundles the full
  dependency tree via electron-builder's automatic production-deps resolver.
- **macOS and Windows**: resolve `ffmpeg-static` and embedded model paths
  to their real on-disk location under `app.asar.unpacked`. Reads via
  `fs.readFile` worked through Electron's asar layer, but `child_process.spawn`
  (used to launch ffmpeg) bypasses asar and was failing silently with ENOENT
  on `speed != 1` or MP3 export.

### macOS

- **Code signing**: builds are now signed with our Apple Developer ID
  (`Developer ID Application: Julia Kafarska (8Y2UTZ2NBZ)`) and hardened
  runtime is enabled. The misleading "Out Loud.app is damaged and can't be
  opened" message is gone. First launch now shows the standard "macOS cannot
  verify the developer" dialog — right-click → **Open** once and macOS
  remembers. No more Terminal commands needed.
- _Notarization is temporarily disabled while Apple's notary service works
  through a backlog. Two submissions sat at status `In Progress` for 24+
  hours during the release window with no movement, so we shipped 1.0.2
  signed-but-not-notarized rather than block the release. We'll re-enable
  in 1.0.3 (just flip `mac.notarize` back to `true` in
  `electron-builder.json` and rebuild) once Apple's queue is healthy. At
  that point first launch will open with no prompt at all. For now, users
  on macOS 15+ have to go through System Settings → Privacy & Security →
  Open Anyway on first launch; older macOS still allows the right-click →
  Open shortcut. See the [README install notes](./README.md#macos-macos-cannot-verify-the-developer-of-out-loud)._
- **Quit crash**: fixed `SIGABRT` on quit caused by V8 tearing down the
  Node environment before the TTS worker finished releasing its ONNX
  session. The main process now hard-terminates the worker before quit so
  the OS reclaims native resources cleanly instead of joining a thread
  mid-finalize.

### Windows

- **TTS engine now loads on fresh Windows installs**. The Out Loud installer
  bundles the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable and installs
  it silently as part of setup. Previously, fresh Windows installs without
  the redistributable failed to load `onnxruntime_binding.node` with the
  cryptic `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` / "Cannot find the specified module" error.
- **Window UX**: stopped applying `titleBarStyle: "hiddenInset"` and the
  invisible drag region on Windows. They're macOS-only constructs that were
  fighting Windows' native title bar and causing the "jumpy / fighting with
  the user" feel on first launch.
- **Error visibility**: TTS errors now surface as a red banner in the UI
  with the worker stack trace and platform info, instead of being silently
  logged. Makes future Windows / cross-platform bugs much easier to report.

### Internal

- Tray-app PATH prefix `/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin` is now applied
  only on macOS so Windows PATH isn't corrupted.
- Release CI workflow consumes signing secrets (`CSC_LINK`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`,
  `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, and the optional
  Windows pair) so the same signed-and-bundled artifacts you can build
  locally are what ships from CI.
